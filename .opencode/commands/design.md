description: Create a design-collection prototype from design notes
---
You are implementing a design prototype inside the design-collection monorepo.
Use the rules in @design-collection/AGENTS.md.

Task:
- Create a new project under design-collection/src/pages/<kebab-case> unless the user specifies a different location.
- Implement a focused prototype using React + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Do not import components or styles from other projects.
- Update design-collection/src/main.tsx to add the route.
- Update design-collection/src/pages/Home.tsx to add a project card.
- Keep the file set minimal for the idea; add only what is needed.

If the design name/slug is unclear, ask one concise question and propose a default slug.
